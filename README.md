# vqmd
Tool for visualization and analysis of data from (Path Integral) Molecular Dynamics simulations.
The aim is to support the output formats of various MD codes by parsing them to a common data structure before further processing occurs.

Currently only supports I-Pi's output files as input. 

Currently import statements seem to work only with Python 3. So if your /usr/bin/python points to Python 2.x, run the code explicitly via Python3.

! WORK IN PROGRESS !
